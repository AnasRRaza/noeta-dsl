# ============================================
# Test 2: Basic Operations on Text Data
# ============================================
# Data File: text_data.csv
# Operations: Load, select, filter, sort, groupby
# ============================================

load "data/text_data.csv" as text
info text
describe text

# SELECT OPERATIONS
select text {id, name, email} as subset1
info subset1
head subset1 with n=10 as subset1_top

select text {id, name, phone} as subset2
head subset2 with n=5 as subset2_top

# FILTER OPERATIONS
filter text where id > 50 as high_ids
info high_ids
head high_ids with n=10 as high_ids_top

# SORTING
sort text by id desc as sorted_desc
head sorted_desc with n=10 as top10

sort text by id asc as sorted_asc
head sorted_asc with n=10 as bottom10

# GROUPBY
groupby text by {name} compute {count: id} as name_counts
describe name_counts

# HEAD AND TAIL
head text with n=20 as first20
tail text with n=20 as last20
