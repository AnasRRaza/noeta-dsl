# Test: Optional 'as' clause
# ============================================
# Tests that head, tail, and sample work without 'as' for quick display
# ============================================

# Load sample data
load "data/sales_data.csv" as sales

# Test 1: head without 'as' - just display
head sales with n=10

# Test 2: tail without 'as' - just display
tail sales with n=5

# Test 3: sample without 'as' - just display
sample sales with n=20

# Test 4: head with 'as' - create alias
head sales with n=15 as top15
describe top15

# Test 5: tail with 'as' - create alias
tail sales with n=10 as bottom10
describe bottom10

# Test 6: sample with 'as' - create alias
sample sales with n=15 random as sample15

# Test 7: Use created aliases in further operations
