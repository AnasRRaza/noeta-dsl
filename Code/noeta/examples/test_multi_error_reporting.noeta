# Multi-Error Reporting Test
# This file demonstrates Noeta's ability to show all semantic errors at once
# instead of stopping at the first error.

# Load valid datasets
load "data/sales_data.csv" as sales
load "data/sales_data.csv" as customers

# These operations will trigger multiple semantic errors:
# 1. Typo in dataset name (sale instead of sales)
select sale with price as prices

# 2. Another typo (custmer instead of customers)
filter custmer where price > 100 as expensive

# 3. Completely undefined dataset
describe nonexistent_data

# 4. Another undefined dataset in simple operation
upper missing_dataset column name as upper_names

# Expected output: All 4 errors shown together, grouped by category (Semantic Errors)
# Each error will show:
# - Line and column number
# - Error message
# - Hint with available datasets
# - "Did you mean" suggestion (for typos)
